# Custom domain configuration for GitHub Pages
# 
# Instructions:
# 1. If you have a custom domain (like fengzhang.com), replace this line with your domain
# 2. If using GitHub Pages default domain, delete this file
# 
# Example: 
# fengzhang.com

# For now, delete this file or leave it empty since you'll use the default GitHub Pages URL
